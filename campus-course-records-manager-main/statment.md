Problem statement
Small institutions often lack a lightweight, local tool to manage students, courses, enrollments, grades, CSV import/export, and backups for teaching, training, and administrative demonstrations.

Scope of the project
Provide an educational, in-memory CLI application implementing domain models, enrollment rules, GPA calculation, CSV import/export, and filesystem backups; excludes databases, web UI, authentication, and production features.

Target users
Students and instructors learning Java domain modeling, educators needing a compact demo for labs, and developers seeking a minimal reference to extend with persistence or a web interface.

High-level features
Student and course CRUD; enrollment management with credit checks; marks-to-grade mapping and GPA computation; CSV import/export for data; and basic filesystem backup utilities and reporting.
